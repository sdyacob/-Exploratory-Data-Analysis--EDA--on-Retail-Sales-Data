📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on a restaurant menu dataset, aimed at uncovering patterns, trends, and actionable insights that could benefit decision-makers in the food and hospitality industry.

With the growing emphasis on data-driven strategies, understanding how menu items are priced, what nutritional values they offer, and how product categories perform can significantly influence marketing, health compliance, and operational decisions. This project bridges the gap between raw data and strategic insights through effective data analysis.

🎯 Objectives
To explore and analyze the structure and distribution of menu items.

To examine key metrics such as price, calories, total fat, and protein levels.

To identify high-value items and high-calorie offerings for strategic menu planning.

To visualize and interpret category-wise item distribution and nutrient correlations.

To strengthen foundational data analysis and Python skills for real-world business contexts.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language used for scripting and analysis.

Pandas – For data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.

Matplotlib – For creating static visualizations to represent distributions and trends.

Seaborn – For advanced statistical plots and correlation heatmaps.

📊 Key Analysis Conducted
Data Inspection: Checked for missing values, data types, and structural inconsistencies.

Data Cleaning: Trimmed column names, handled nulls, and ensured numeric types for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: Derived key statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range.

Visual Analysis:

Histograms for Price, Calories, Fat, and Protein distributions.

Bar charts for item counts by category.

Boxplots (optional enhancement) to detect outliers in pricing.

Heatmaps to visualize correlation between numerical nutritional metrics.

Insight Generation:

Average pricing across the menu.

Count of high-calorie items (>500 kcal).

Most common food category.

Identification of top 10 expensive items.

✅ Outcomes & Learnings
Developed a clear understanding of real-world data preprocessing challenges.

Gained hands-on experience in statistical analysis and effective data storytelling.

Strengthened proficiency in Python-based data science tools.

Learned how to interpret visual patterns to support practical business recommendations.

Demonstrated the ability to convert raw data into meaningful, decision-ready insights.
